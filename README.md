# image-editor-demo
This is a demo for an image editing solution on the web

## About
- To create an image editor that produces a saveable image, I used the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). 

- The actual implementation of the Canvas API is done within the `ImageEditor` class

- This class implements the `zoomImage()` and `moveImage()` methods, which handle the basic use cases for this application

- `controls.js` contains the logic for both mouse and touch-based inputs

Here is a video to demonstrate the basic funtionality of this app
